    "## Explain the \"Chocolate Feast\" problem from HackerRank.\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Auntie Penny's shop has a special promotion where you can exchange chocolate wrappers for free chocolates. This problem determines the total chocolates we can get by purchasing them and trading wrappers at the shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 6<br />\n",
    "c = 2<br />\n",
    "m = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the given details, the budget is 6, each chocolate is 2, and 2 wrappers get a free chocolate:<br />\n",
    "- With a budget of 6, we can buy 3 chocolates (6 divided by 2).\n",
    "- These 3 chocolates give us 3 wrappers. Trading 2 wrappers gets us a free chocolate, which brings total chocolates to 4.\n",
    "- This new chocolate gives another wrapper. We now have 2 wrappers to trade another chocolate. So, the total chocolates are 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize the **chocolates** variable by dividing **n** by **c**.\n",
    "- Next, assign the **wrappers** variable to the value of **chocolates**.\n",
    "- While loops trading **wrappers** until it is below the rate **m**.\n",
    "  - **n // c**: Determine how many new chocolates are received by trading wrappers.\n",
    "  - **(wrappers % m) + new_chocolates**: Calculate the extra wrappers using the modulo operation with the rate **m**, then add the wrappers obtained from the new chocolates.\n",
    "  - **chocolates += new_chocolates**: Update the total chocolates by adding the new ones.\n",
    "- Return the total count of **chocolates**."
