    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The store's Halloween Sale offers special discounts to customers who purchase multiple games with a given budget of **s** dollars.<br />\n",
    "And the available promotions are:\n",
    "- Purchasing the first game is priced **p** dollars.\n",
    "- For each game purchase, the price decreases by **d** dollars until it reaches a minimum price of **m** dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "p = 20<br />\n",
    "d = 3<br />\n",
    "m = 6<br />\n",
    "s = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the provided information, the given budget is 80 dollars. So, we can purchase a maximum of 6 video games, listed in the following sequence:<br />\n",
    "- First game: \\\\$20, leaving \\\\$60 in the budget.\n",
    "- Second game: 20 - 3 = \\\\$17, leaving \\\\$43 in the budget.\n",
    "- Third game: 17 - 3 = \\\\$14, leaving \\\\$29 in the budget.\n",
    "- Fourth game: 14 - 3 = \\\\$11, leaving \\\\$18 in the budget.\n",
    "- Fifth game: 14 - 3 = \\\\$8, leaving \\\\$10 in the budget.\n",
    "- Sixth game: 8 - 3 = \\\\$5, which is less than the minimum price **m**, so the price remains \\\\$8, leaving \\\\$2 (10 - 8) in the budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "- Set the initial count of purchased games to **0**.\n",
    "- While loops each purchase by subtracting from the budget until it reaches the minimum price:\n",
    "  - **p > m**: Check if the price **p** is greater than the minimum price **m**.\n",
    "  - **s >= p**: Check if the budget **s** is enough to purchase the game at its current price.\n",
    "    - **s -= p**: Decrease the game's price from the current budget.\n",
    "    - **count += 1**: Increase the count of purchased game.\n",
    "    - **p = max(p - d, p)**: Decrease the game's price by **d**, but keep it above the minimum price **m**.\n",
    "- Add the result of the current budget divided by the latest game's price to the count of purchased games **count += s // p**.\n",
    "- Return the value of **count**.\n"
