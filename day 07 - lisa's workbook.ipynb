    "## Explain the \"Lisa's Workbook\" problem from HackerRank.\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Lisa got a new math workbook, which organized exercise problems into groups within chapters. She guessed that every special problem should retain an index similar to the book chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose the workbook has 5 chapters with 4, 2, 6, 1, and 10 problems in each, and every page can obtain to k problems, with variables defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 5<br />\n",
    "k = 3<br />\n",
    "arr = [4, 2, 6, 1, 10]<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the solution step by step:\n",
    "- **Chapter 1** contains 4 problems:\n",
    "  - **Page 1** includes problems 1, 2, and 3, with problem 1 identified as a special problem.\n",
    "  - **Page 2**  includes problem 4, which is not identified as a special problem.\n",
    "- **Chapter 2** contains 2 problems:\n",
    "  - **Page 3** includes problems 1 and 2, with problem 2 identified as a special problem.\n",
    "- **Chapter 3** contains 6 probles:\n",
    "  - **Page 4** includes problems 1, 2, and 3, with problem 3 identified as a special problem.\n",
    "  - **Page 5** includes problems 4, 5, and 6, without any special problems.\n",
    "- **Chapter 4** contains 1 problem:\n",
    "  - **Page 6** includes problem 1, which is not identified as a special problem.\n",
    "- **Chapter 5** contains 10 problems:\n",
    "  - **Page 7** includes problems 1, 2, and 3, without any special problems.\n",
    "  - **Page 8** includes problems 4, 5, and 6, with problem 5 identified as a special problem.\n",
    "  - **Page 9** includes problems 7, 8, and 9, without any special problems.\n",
    "  - **Page 10** includes problem 10, which is not identified as a special problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set initial values of **page** to 1 and **count** to 0.\n",
    "- The first loop iterates through chapters in the workbook.\n",
    "  - The second loop iterates through problems in the current chapter, processing **k** problems during each iteration.\n",
    "    - Check if the current page number is between the **start** and **end** problems.\n",
    "      - Increment **count** by 1.\n",
    "    - Increment **page** by 1.\n",
    "- Return the value of **count**."
